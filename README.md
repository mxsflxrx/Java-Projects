# Java-Projects

Welcome to the second chapter of my coding journey! This repository contains my Java programming projects developed during the second semester of my first year in college. After getting started with C, diving into Java opened up a whole new world of object-oriented programming and modern software development concepts.

## ABout the Projects

These projects were a mix of coursework assignments and personal explorations, helping me build a strong foundation in Java. Some of the key topics and skills I explored include:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Basic GUI applications (Swing or JavaFX if applicable)
- Exception handling
- Collections and data structures
- File handling

## About the Repo

This repository serves as a collection of all the Java projects I created during my second semester of college. Each folder or file represents a different assignment or mini-project I worked on while learning the fundamentals of Java programming.

Whether you're a fellow student just starting out, someone looking for basic Java examples, or just curious about my early workâ€”you're welcome to explore, learn, or even give feedback!
